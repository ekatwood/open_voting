A Turing-complete modern democracy solution

Open Voting: an open-source solution for modern democracy implementations

Assumptions: users have access to a modern smart phone with facial recognition and thumb print reader, as well as access to data or wifi.

I propose a general solution for counting votes using a combination of KYC, easy to use user interface, and the blockchain AZERO to validate and count votes.

KYC (know your customer) will be used to register voters, using facial recognition and verification using driver’s license, passport or other proof of uniqueness / realness. A good example would be Passbase. This implementation could be made using their API.

User interface will be developed using Google’s Flutter framework. This is a new but very effective framework, that enables the developer to have one codebase for their web app, iPhone app, and Android app. It uses Firebase to host applications, which is a nice and easy-to-use cloud interface.

Blockchains have many purposes, many of them economic related. However, one of the simplest but most effective thing a blockchain can do is count votes in an open-source manner. When users vote with their unique wallet address, you can count votes while maintaining anonymity. 

Features: any user can make a general poll for all users to respond to, and government officials (like a senator from a state) can create polls that only particular subsets of the users can reply to (ex. Massachusetts senator creates a poll, and only Massachusetts residents can reply).

Users will also be able to vote “Yay” or “Nay” on real bills that are currently in Congress. The app will employ law experts to read the bills and translate them into layman terms, and provide a succinct summary of the bill itself.

Conclusion: with the advent of smart phones, general connectivity to data or wifi, and advanced and scalable blockchains like AZERO, a “Turing-complete” software solution can be created to facilitate the functions required for a functioning democracy.
